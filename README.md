# housing_extension

I wrote a chrome extension that would watch housing information on a specific facebook page. 

It is so hard to find married student housing, I wanted an extra edge. So this extension would comment and like on listings that fit a certain critera. 

It was pretty cool and worked really well. We ended up finding housing.
